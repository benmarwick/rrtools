## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file)
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations
  - [:file\_folder:
    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):
    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents
    prepared and collected during the analysis.

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/{{{username}}}/{{{repo}}}/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:
- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
- run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).
- finally, open `paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`.
